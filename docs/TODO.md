[TODO01]
- [ ]

TASK: Extract data from the spec and populate `tags.md` with the relevant data
REF: [spec.md](/docs/spec.md|## CLI SPECIFICATIONS)
```
> Bill Clye documents, categorizes and collects data from syntax and languages for future database usage, all predetermined essential data should be entered into the Bill Clye documents.
```

- _This section contains a global dictionary of all the terms and their definitions that are used in the documentation._
- _If any definitions have exact duplicates in other languages, identiy the additional utilization with tag `+LANG_USE` but always keep the more widely accepted or pupular nametype for these documents

[TODO02]
- [ ]

TASK: Is it plausible to use both `bill` and `billye` as the MAIN cli command call? If so, SKIP `TODO2`
FILE: [spec.md](/docs/spec.md|## INTRODUCTION)
```
`BILL CLYE` CLI output features (pulled from the designed database) in the initial design will be minimal, but that does not mean the DEVELOPMENT and SPEC will be minimal.
> command: <!-- [TODO01: DECIDE ON ONE DEFINITIVE COMMAND] --> `bill`, `billye`
```

- (1).SPEC_DESIGN_PURPOSE: To maximize initial CLI design depth, the first spec will focus on full scope foundational modular cli development, if done correctly `database_display_integration` should be much easier.
  - `database_display_integration`: The CLI pulling data from the database, and displaying them in the CLI, such as the (currently planned) integration 'docstrings'.
