# BILL CLYE - The Syntax CLI

_BILL CLYE The Syntax CLI is a(nod, and homage to `Bill Nye the Science Guy`) CLI database that allows you to display and render different example of common codebases._

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `BILL CLYE` initial design should contain comprehensive, future proof, documented, modular codebase. The output features in the initial design will be minimal, but that does not mean the DEVELOPMENT and SPEC will be minimal. The implications of the future support and design spec, indicate that this codebase design must be comprehensive from its foundations. The modular design should be created full scope, with weighted attention focused on developing user quality of life, database integration, CLI design and inclusivity. The foundations should be so in deopth and comprehensiove, that the `docstring` display format functions and modules should be an easy, modular injection / integration.
> Once the initial design is completed, shipped, stabilized and launched, the `future_roadmap` will be considered. The `future_roadmap` will be a list of features that will be implemented in the future, and will be considered in the development of the `BILL CLYE` CLI.
> The `future_roadmap` will be a list of features that will be implemented in the future, and will be considered in the development of the quality of life, and modular foundations `BILL CLYE` CLI **BUT** additional output display modules will not be integrated past the `docstrings`. The weighted focus will stay on the comprehensive foundational development and expansion.

- Im currently creating examples and drafts of doc strings. im creating a research database on them first.
- The database contains many docstring definitions, examples, research, and very basic statistic definitions that can be objectively accepted by most.

## REQUIREMENTS

_Below you will find the requirements for the initial, foundational design for `BILL CLYE`

### MODULAR DESIGN

- The cli should be modular, meaning that it should be able to be used in different ways.
- The initial design will be to display and render different examples of docstrings, once that is completed, shipped, stabilized and launched, `future_roadmap` will be considered.

### `current_roadmap`

- `WILL CLYE` docstrings, once that is completed, shipped, stabilized and launched, `future_roadmap` will be considered.
- `database`: definitions, examples, very basic statistic definitions that can be `objectively_accepted`[] by most.
- Syntax highlighting for all input docstrings

#### `future_roadmap`

## CLI DICTIONARY

[!NOTE]:
>
> - _This section contains a global dictionary of all the terms and their definitions that are used in the documentation._
> - _If any definitions have exact duplicates in other languages, identiy the additional utilization with tag `[+LANG_USE]` but always keep the more widely accepted or pupular nametype for these documents_

### PARENT

`OBJ_ACC`, `objective_acceptane` - A statement or claim, that while still being disputable, such disputes would render the operator in a position that is not serious; SEE [`semantics`]
`SEM`, `semantics` - Semantics
`DEF`, `definition` - Definition
`NOTE`, `note` - Note
`CLAIM`, `claim` - Claim
`CLAIM`, `claim` - Claim

`CLAIM` - Claim
`Semantics` - Semantics
`docstring` - Docstring
`research` - Research
`statistic` - Statistic
`example` - Example
`validated` - Validated
`experimental` - Experimental
`optimal` - Optimal
`unstable` - Unstable
`visually_appealing` - Visually Appealing
`creative` - Creative

> Pointy Numerical Index - A numerical and bracket hierachal index design

```pindx
<(1)
  CLAIM:{
    sky_color:"The color of the observable sky is blue during the day"
      objective_acceptance:[
        "No further specification given, the sky is blue.",
        "The sky is blue almost always, the claim obviously corresponds to the way humans witness the sky majority of time."
        ],
      semantics:[
        "They sky is grey when its overcast at daytime",
        "One could argue the sky is orange during a sunset"
        ]
    },

<(2)
  CLAIM:{
    hand_fingers:"Humans have 5 fingers on each hand"
      objective_acceptance:[
        "Humans have 5 fingers on each hand",
        ],
      semantics:[
        "Humans have 4 fingers and one thumb"
        ]

### INTER-DOCUMENT DEFINITIONS

- `github_flavor` - The flavor of the documentation that is used to define the documentation.

<!--
  THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT THAT IS BEING UPDATED AS DEVELOPMENT PROGRESSES. IT WILL EVENTUALLY BE UTILIZED AS THE ABSOLUTE SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR THE DATABASE DURING DEVELOPMENT. ALL DATA IN THIS DOCUMENT MUST BE COHERENT, AND CONSISTENT.
-->

## DATABASE EXAMPLES

### ABSOLUTE TRUTH VERSION (updated version)
>
> This python docstring is the most up to date, relevant version, all other versions of any OFFICIAL LANGUAGE supported docstring should be formatted to fit this spec.

```python
"""
format: github
purpose: visual_styling
