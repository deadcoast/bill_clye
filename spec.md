# BILL CLYE - The Syntax CLI

_BILL CLYE The Syntax CLI is a(nod, and homage to `Bill Nye the Science Guy`) CLI database that allows you to display and render different example of common codebases._

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `BILL CLYE` initial design should focus on comprehensive, future proof, documented, modular codebase.

## INTRODUCTION

`BILL CLYE` CLI output features (pulled from the designed database) in the initial design will be minimal, but that does not mean the DEVELOPMENT and SPEC will be minimal.

- (1).SPEC_DESIGN_PURPOSE: To maximize initial CLI design depth, the first spec will focus on full scope foundational modular cli development, if done correctly `database_display_integration` should be much easier.
  - `database_display_integration`: The CLI pulling data from the database, and displaying them in the CLI, such as the (currently planned) integration 'docstrings'.
- (2).DESIGN_IMPLICATIONS: The implications of the future support and design spec, indicate that this codebase design must be comprehensive from its foundations.
- (3) The modular design should be created full scope, with weighted attention focused on developing user quality of life, database integration, CLI design and inclusivity.
- (4) The foundations should be so in deopth and comprehensiove, that the `docstring` display format functions and modules should be an easy, modular injection / integration.
- (5) After the initial design is completed, shipped, stabilized and launched, the `future_roadmap` will be considered. The `future_roadmap` will be a list of features that will be implemented in the future, and will be considered in the development of the `BILL CLYE` CLI.
- (6).FUTURE_ROADMAP: a list of features that will be implemented in the future, and will be considered in the development of the quality of life, and modular foundations `BILL CLYE` CLI **BUT** additional output display modules will not be integrated past the `docstrings`.

**The weighted focus will stay on the comprehensive foundational development and expansion.**

DEVELOPMENT_STAGE: `PLANNING`

## CLI DESIGN

LANGUAGE: `Python`
CLI_ECOSYSTEM: `Rich`

### REQUIREMENTS

_Below you will find mandatory requirements for the initial, foundational design for `BILL CLYE`_

### COMPREHENSIVE MODULAR CLI DESIGN FOCUS

- The cli should be modular, meaning that it should be able to be used in different ways.
- The initial design will be to display and render different examples of docstrings, once that is completed, shipped, stabilized and launched, `future_roadmap` will be considered.

### `current_roadmap`

- `WILL CLYE` docstrings, once that is completed, shipped, stabilized and launched, `future_roadmap` will be considered.
- `database`: definitions, examples, very basic statistic definitions that can be `objectively_accepted`[] by most.
- Syntax highlighting for all input docstrings

#### `future_roadmap`

## CLI SPECIFICATIONS

[!NOTE]
> Bill Clye documents, categorizes and collects data from syntax and languages
> All official supported languages data must be documented for the database

- _This section contains a global dictionary of all the terms and their definitions that are used in the documentation._
- _If any definitions have exact duplicates in other languages, identiy the additional utilization with tag `[+LANG_USE]` but always keep the more widely accepted or pupular nametype for these documents_
