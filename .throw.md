# CLARIFICATION AND REVISIONS

[1] OUTSIDE OF STANDARD MARKDOWN FORMATTING(e.g.; bold, italics, `-`, `*` bullet notes, etc., etc.,). (2) Provide me a comprehensive list of github accepted formatting that i can utilize to modernize my academic research notes. (3) These are not official notes, my official notes format has been completed in latex. (4) these notes are for aesthetic, and visual formatting purposes only. (5) Github offers the most simple solution, with the most advanced supported output rendering.

```python
docstring:[
    "validated",
    "experimental",
    "optimal",
    "unstable",
    "visually_appealing",
    "creative"
  ]

```

- Im currently creating examples and drafts of doc strings. im creating a research database on them first.
- The database contains many docstring definitions, examples, research, and very basic statistic definitions that can be objectively accepted by most.

> WHAT IS OBJECTIVE ACCEPTANCE?

- Objective acceptance is a statement or claim, that while still being disputable, such disputes would put the disputee in a position that is not serious. SEE the pseudo code index below:

```pindx
<(1)
  CLAIM:{
    sky_color:"The color of the observable sky is blue during the day"
      objective_acceptance:[
        "No further specification given, the sky is blue.",
        "The sky is blue almost always, the claim obviously corresponds to the way humans witness the sky majority of time."
        ],
      semantics:[
        "They sky is grey when its overcast at daytime",
        "One could argue the sky is orange during a sunset"
        ]
    },

<(2)
  CLAIM:{
    hand_fingers:"Humans have 5 fingers on each hand"
      objective_acceptance:[
        "Humans have 5 fingers on each hand",
        ],
      semantics:[
        "Humans have 4 fingers and one thumb"
        ]
    },
